# Hatalogico
Libraries for the Hatalogico Raspberry Pi Hat

All the python files required to drive the I2C chips on the Hatalogico were written and are maintained by [Adafruit Industries](https://www.adafruit.com/). I have simply included them as submodules and written a few examples using them.

Before using these files, you need to setup your Pi for GPIO and I2C (note the Pi 2 has a slightly different method for the latter).

**Big thanks to Adafruit without whom the Hatalogico would just be a mug coaster.**
